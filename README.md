# FunctionContextComponent-hook
I'm not familiar with a specific "FunctionContextComponent-hook" in React or any related library or technology as of my last knowledge update in September 2021. It's possible that there have been new developments or libraries introduced in the React ecosystem after that date, which I'm not aware of.
